# Wait

We wait and wait and wait, spending so many hours of our lives waiting on others.

We wait to see a doctor, we wait to speak to the boss, we wait to hear back for a decision

we wait for the code to compile

we wait for our food to get cold, so it won’t burn our tongue

we wait for the storm to end, before we head out for a ride

we wait and wait until we can afford to buy some light

we wait for a friendly message from a dearly friend who’s possibly lost

we wait days and days for perfect holiday

and we wait some more to get on that plane and yes we can finally get high!

we even wait for our patience to grow

Just so we can wait some more

we wait for our child to grow up

so we can teach them how to be patient

we tell them good things come to those who wait

for long and long hours but don’t let the count of seconds spoil your hope

I know my child, life sucks when you are on the hold

but listen to the melody and sing along, that’ll teach you how to cope

I know very little, I have waited my whole life to know some more

I’m genuinely tired of waiting, just want to let go

Don’t look grim my sweetheart

This is what you signed up for

whether you like it or not

I’m not harsh or anything but don’t expect me to be soft

Oh I how long the bright warm nights 

With a gentle breeze from down bottom of the bright lights

Please just finish me before you let me fall

For that I don’t have the guts to even try flapping my arms

This is stupid, this is not what I want

But I miss memories and ideas of a perfect life

I’ve forgotten the past, got stuck in the presence can’t see the future

Is this what I get for wanting a better life?

I’m not ungracious please don’t get me wrong

But I don’t get how my heart was just right

It’s far gone I’ve been long left behind

Keep searching for meanings, something from nothing

When did I find out how to rhyme?

I miss what’s in front of me, I can’t quite grab on

For my happiness is short-lived 

A little charm, and you’re no longer ordinary
