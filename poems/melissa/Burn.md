# Burn

Look at what they have done

Nothing will make them learn

Nothing will make them pay

They don’t know how it feels

To sit and watch your life disappear

Feel? There is nothing to feel anymore

Numbness is all there is left

Hate? they say it’s to avoid

Love? they say is to give

What’s left in the end?

When there is nothing to give us peace

Burn, look at the way it kills and burns

Innocence washed away, as if it was never there

The clock is ticking, still awaiting for the happiness to enter the door

I don’t know where all the time has gone by 

While stuck in this frozen world

Care? I don’t care anymore

Look at the way things turn

Look at the tower of hope falling into pieces and burn

Watch, watch the fire and learn

Caress the land, it’s the last comfort you will ever earn

Touch, place your hands on the cold cold land

Soon it will become as hot as a frying pan

Soon there will be nothing left

I will be gone, this will be all behind

Waited and waited for it to turn around

Tomorrow comes when it’s too late


Grasp my hand, feel my heart

Feel the burn, fear the wrath

As there is nothing left, there is nothing for me to fear

Nothing will make you learn

Nothing will make you see

Nothing will make you pay


This is what I get for wanting

This is what you turn things into

This will go back and forth

And will never stop

Until you open your eyes, and watch them suffer

Look at how it feels, listen to them scream

Look at how it burns, look at how it ends
