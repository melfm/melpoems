I wanna be a tree, settling on my roots \
I wanna be a bird so I can fly away \
I wanna be a river so I can flow away\
I wanna be a cloud, so I can easily disappear \
I wanna be a stone ... 

I want to be a wall so I can keep people away \
I wanna be anything, but walking this earth \
I wanna be a star knowing that one day I will burst \
I wanna be a song, that one will never forget 

I wanna be a forest with a hidden maze \
I wanna be a lion eager for a chase 

I wanna be a boat ready for a storm \
I wanna be a tornado, just wanting to destroy \
I wanna be a house, keeping you safe  

I wanna be a horse so I can run forever  \
I wanna be a tiger, fearless of my opponent \
I wanna be fear, making you feel scared \
I wanna be hope, when you think there's none left 

I wanna be love, fooling you with words \
I wanna be hate, stabbing you afterwards

I wanna be a child, playing guilt free \
I wanna be a cake, so you can take a bite of me

I wanna be a dog, just to be your best mate  \
I wanna be an ant, just so I can die as you take a step

I wanna be fire, keeping you warm \
I wanna be a hug, keeping you right nearby

I wanna be a flower, blowing you away with my scent \
I wanna be a cage, never letting you escape 

I wanna be a mountain, standing tall between you and your dreams \
I wanna be anything, but a damsel in distress  

I wanna be a bee, always working away \
I wanna be a plane, taking you to the bay  

I wanna be a butterfly so I can enjoy being pretty \
I wanna be a smile, decorating your face indefinitely 

I wanna be air, so you can take me whole in \
I wanna be a kiss, taking off from your lips \
I wanna be a paper, giving you good news \
I wanna be anything but this tired soul that sucks away all the muse

I wanna be patience, so I can afford to wait forever \
I wanna be soil, burrying my feelings deeply hidden  

I wanna be a love song, making you cry \
I wanna be tears, so I can fall from your pretty eyes 

I wanna be chocolate, making you crave \
I wanna be a soldier, so I can be brave  

I wanna be a bed, so you can lie on me \
I wanna be a doll, so you can fall asleep while holding me 

I wanna be a pillow, supporting your head \
I wanna be the sky, where I stretch to no end  

I wanna be a king, ruling over land \
I wanna be a queen, always supporting my man 

I wanna be ice cream, so I can melt away \
I wanna be anything, but a body that will just waste away  

I wanna be vodka, so you can down me fast \
I wanna be your favorite, so you never pick me last 

I wanna be a bull, so I can charge with rage  \
I wanna be the sea, so I can amaze you with my calm waves

I wanna be strawberry, so you can cherish my sweetness \
I wanna be lemon, so you can frown at my sourness  

I wanna be grass, supporting your every step \
I wanna be light, shinning when it seems there's no path left  

I wanna be a piano, so that you can play me \
I wanna be a cat, so I can enjoy unlimited lying in

I wanna be lies whispering in your ears \
I wanna be the truth, staring right at your face

I wanna be a composer, making sweet melodies \
I wanna be a disco disc, reflecting all the light around me

I wanna be a nightmare waking you up from sweet dreams \
I wanna be a blanket, wrapping you until you can no longer breathe

I can go on, with my list of things \
But in the end these are all just hopeless dreams!
