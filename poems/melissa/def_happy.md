# What is happy

Is it to see the sun right at the end of a storm

Or hopping through the hills of this mighty (?) hole?

Am I crazy to genuinely feel sick of your snore?

Or to want to rise and never be afraid to soar

I am happy when the birds don’t make any noise

Or when I walk into the woods, to hear the lions roar

Am I crazy to step right into this hoax

or is this just an illusion of wanting to score?

Oh man I know what happy is, how could one not know

Sometimes happiness means to be able to just ignore

Oh lord will you just pick up the phone?

The wind’s blowing stronger, my mind’s getting mixed up in too many words

I want to shout and beg you to give me what I am worth

Am I not good enough or do you just like to see me sob

I’m not a fool you know, I’m at least 24

No big deal, cuz it’s a long road

You will know the feeling when you see the blade of my sword

But don’t be afraid, I’m not exactly super bored

I’m sure this is a cool story, I just can’t quite sing with the chord

As the end is not clear, one must just keep making up words
