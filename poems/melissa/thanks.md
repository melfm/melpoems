Thanks for helping me let go of the past
Thanks for making me choose my current path
Thanks for putting me in charge of painting the future

Thanks for making me feel so full of love
Thanks for making me share it even if in the end I accomplish nothing, I made people smile & that is just enough!
Thanks for making me appreciate the trees
Even if I don't understand what they try to whisper into my ears when I'm feeling too deep

Thanks for making me dream to fly
Even though I have no wings, I'm no angel after all
Thanks for making me want to always soar
Every now & then I switch and dive in deep until there is no where to go
