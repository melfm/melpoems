What is the worse the worse the worse that can happen to you, to me, to us when we expect the least surprise
how can it be worse and worse and worse and worse , when it appears it's already at the bottom line
This is not how it works
When it starts to feel a little worse
We tried to find some hope
All we found was a bunch of souls
Right through their screaming laughter
We drove ourselves into the darkness of our secrets
Until we were no longer us
Just two lost souls, waiting for a storm to take us apart
None of us could sleep
At the horrors that were facing us
Only to realize, we are the real monsters
And not what was right in front of us
We got down on our knees
Please be kind and make this stop
We took one wrong turn and somehow got sucked into a spiral of dust

Darkness was surprised at the presence of our thoughts
We are young until we are not
We are pretty until we rot
We love until we don't
We hate and can never stop
We pray when there's no light
We fix what seems not right
We take what we seek
We let our hearts run wild

We try until we fail
We laugh until we cry
We cry until we laugh
We then laugh and cry
Until there are no more emotions left

In the midst of all this confusion
We then ask ourselves
How did we end up here
In such convoluted universe

There must be a way for us to get back
But as long as we are together there shall be no path
This is the scary part where we must depart
I let go of you and you let go of me
Until there's nothing holding us back

You tell me darling don't worry
This is for the best
We were not meant to be
Together we created the worst versions of ourselves
I don't know if I'm relieved, or just filled with despise
But I must save myself
From this ugliness you comprise
