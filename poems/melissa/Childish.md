# Childish

Sometimes I think I’m just being a child

whose candy got stolen in a matter of a bad luck

I cry and cry and cry, god why is life so unfair, it was just a candy after all

Then I stop and think, what did I ever do wrong

Did I deserve it or am I just being too wry


Sometimes I feel that I should try, keep on fighting for what is worth my time

Although I try to stay strong, I then fall and bruise my leg, man that starts to feel rough


We want what we want, are we being selfish or just contrived?

I see some light at the end of the tunnel

But when I reach it, it turns out to be a firefly


There is a lot of bump, fasten your seat belt tight

This journey is no mistake, be easy and enjoy the ride

My vision goes blurry, my heart goes numb

I feel like nothing, what’s the matter, is there something wrong

I then hear a voice, saying stay where you are

Don’t try to hang on to things, they will eat you up

Let go and don’t fear of nothingness, Embrace the weightlessness and the dark

I then shout back, where are you darling, are you also hidden in the dark?

I then feel comfort of the thought of being numb

I smile and laugh thinking gosh I’ve been so dumb

I should never have been scared of darkness, always seeking light

For what the light blinds you so badly, leaving you in the dark
