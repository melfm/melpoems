# Random jinx

Let them blow, let them sing

No one gives a crap about what they think

In no time I’ll be out of here, safe and sick

Before the world gets smaller than it already is

Because I am mad, and will make them pay

I will walk out of this world, let the gods frown upon me

There are too many of us, ungrateful, hateful 

Afraid of consequences of our next action or thought

We teach our children, the lesson of goodness

I used to be sweet, I used to be bitter

Now I’m nothing like I used to be, as all I feel is sour

It’s curious timing as I go out of sync

When my mind keeps piling up random jinx
