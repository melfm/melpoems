# Lie to make you smile

Oh you pretty thing

Fear not, I will make you anything

I’ll wipe away your tears

That moisten your sweet cheeks

You want to soar, you want to disappear

Step back and think, before you decipher into the sea

If you are ready, pledge and do not dread

For I will be with you, every step ahead

Deluded in the murk, I know my dear

Open your eyes and do not dither


Nothing and everything is what you want

I am the master at giving life

If you are ready, don’t have a second thought

Give me your hand, and prepare to be stunned


I may be full of shit, I may even lie

But at least I managed to make you smile
