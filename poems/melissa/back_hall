Back hall
##############################
The body that heals
The Peace that it brings
The Frustration that it kills

The doubts that pack their bags and leave
The sorrows see no shelter to seize
The pain is the scream of unhappiness
The monsters that become your friends at time of loneliness
Somehow you become addicted to their ugliness

The joys that become meaningless
The laughters that lose their shape and become means of despair

The darkness that feels like home
The dampness of the caves that are comforting of hope
The long path that is ahead of you
Crowded with uncertainty that's all about you

The fear that is too afraid to show up
The moments that are just too emotional

The weaknesses that float like icebergs
Try to drown you to the bottom of their endless cold

The silence you seek is not in the outer space
If you search deep down you may find surprises

The leashes you try to put on this world
Only to realize somethings just cannot be tamed
