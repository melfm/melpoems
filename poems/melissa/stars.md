# Stars

Stars are too faraway\
Just as the thought of you\
That takes my mind far far ahead

I can only look, take a little peak\
But the truth is, they are way out of my reach

There's a little sad tune playing \
Somehow the stars can hear, they start to dance to the melody of empathy

There's beauty in the mind with blind eyes\
For nothing's too implausible for the mind to comprise

Although the thought of you is sweet and dreamy\
But even the stars can tell, being with you makes me too needy

I should learn to dance to the happy tune of your smile \
Maybe that way you can see I'm not completely lost afterall


What's hard is the thought of you \
That intermingles with my tangled mind \
In ways that I cannot comprehend \
In worlds where the image of you, pictures the perfect friend

The stars slowly start to faint away \
I think to myself, here's another dream just wasted away

If I were to give advice \
I'd say just open your eyes \
The world is beautiful and It's ok to take a pause \
And appreciate the beauty in the stars \
Although it's sad to see them die \
Remember the death of a star is the birth of another in a galaxy not so far \
You might think it's the end, but it's just another start


I keep glancing at the stars, they want to send me a message \
I try to decipher, but either there is a bug or I can't quite manage \
They try to talk, while they blink in and out of state \
It's hard to keep track of the constant madness in their gaits

It might be the last moments of the dying stars \
But they are trying to warn me \
Not to waste away my time

Although it's confusing to hear this at first \
But eventually the messiness goes away\
And it all starts to make sense!
