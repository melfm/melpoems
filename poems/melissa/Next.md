You're getting cold, wanting to be friends

I'm getting hot wanting to have sex


Boy I think I broke you hard

while slagging you off,

Thinking you didn't give a damn

Even agreed with me at first ....


I don't complain nor I have regrets

I totally enjoyed the fire in our first kiss


You like to lie in, I like to go ride

Despite our differences we had a pretty good time


I wanted to be your girl, blind you with my kindness!

You pushed me away when I just wanted hot sex

I don't blame you cuz I'm a tough case


I'd like to smile and give you one last kiss

I liked your little tunes, and not how you always beat me in chess


It's not big deal, we shall move on

Let's not waste time and call forth for next!
