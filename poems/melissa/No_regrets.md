# No regrets

Leave no regrets, this is your life and it is all fine.

Keep dreaming on, never let distractions float you on

Close your eyes and put a smile on

Eye floaters will eventually move on

Keep it lively, don’t let it die

For every rhythm keep it alive



Time will pass, might even leave you behind

But don’t worry, you will catch on (Or Have no fear, as you will catch on)

The wind will flow, dragging you on

But the world will be a new one   (Or the new world will be a good one)

Don’t hesitate, give it a real good kick on and on

This is life, and experiment after all

Have no doubt, and life will go on
