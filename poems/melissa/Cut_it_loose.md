# Cut it loose

I admire your resilience

Even at the times of grievance

Nothing can break that arrogance

The voices in the head

All mixed and intermingled

Nothing makes sense, nothing’s clear

Things appear as though half-way surreal

Among the steps taken to get here

A few felt like a hitch, all muddled up with fear

To think this world is kind to hand in all your desires

To think you would get away with murder if your mind’s clear

For the mind is always on the verge of a chaotic trouble

I daresay I overestimated my power

When building a nest on top of a falling tower

Looking back as flying away

This is the life depicted somewhere so deep in my head

When everything made sense for all but in the end

When hope goes down, I must find a target to blame

Things used to be crystal clear

I can’t remember a time when things felt so surreal

Please remind me how ..

I cut it loose, I cut myself free

Love me or love me not

It is the time that will tell what’s right and what’s wrong

Slipping through your arms

Don’t expect me to stay here or there

When there is no place for me in your heart

I’d be lying to say I knew from day one

But I took a good damn guess

The first time I looked upon those eyes

I never know how it starts, but always see it die

…

If I tell you facts based on my virtue

I’d be lying as you won’t find that from top down to my toes

I’ll tell you what you want to hear as long as you make me feel

Play me a song, soon after disappear

As I don’t have too much time, apologies if I’m being sincere

There is nothing nice about me, but there is nothing to fear

As I am nothing and everything tangled in this world

Sometimes I feel the urge to picture the worst outcome

As it pleases me nothing more than a dramatic finale

It’s true that my heart is numb

it cares little about anything but its desire

But you will see in the end, it will be a pretty picture after all

To think I can do this all by myself

I wanted so much, now all I want is nothing

The oddly quiet voices in my head have left me empty handed
