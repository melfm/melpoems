Some days are hard and some days are fucked up,

Some days never end and while others never show up,

But when things get tough,

And friends act rough,

Just remember only one thing matters the most,

That's the dream held in your heart so close



So persevere,

And have no fear,

Because after this day is gone,

Your dream will still live on,

The strength in your heart,

Cannot be taken apart,

Screw this day and everyone in it too,

Cos' when you're living the dream, the last laugh is on you!
